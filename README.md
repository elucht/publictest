# Nonprofit Data Warehouse Quickstart

Data warehouses enable organizations to get the most out of their data by aggregating multi-source data and transforming it so that organizations can layer analytics and generate important insights. 

The Nonprofit Data Warehouse Quickstart is a pre-packaged, ‘one-click deployment,’ Azure based data warehouse proof-of-concept. For the purposes of the POC, the Quickstart integrates sample data from IATI and The WHO Water and Sanitation Report and the Quickstart with CDM integrates with the Microsoft Common Data Model Nonprofit Accelerator.
